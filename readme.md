# Deep Neural Network for MNIST Classification 


The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. We can find more about it on Yann LeCun's website (Director of AI Research, Facebook). He is one of the pioneers of complex approaches that are widely used today, such as covolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image).

The goal is to write an algorithm that detects which digit is written. Since there are only 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), this is a classification problem with 10 classes.

Libraries used in this notebook are -
  - TensorFlow
  - NumPy

In this notebook, I have done variations in the same model (Sequential) by changing the hyperparameters of the model like learning rate, number of epochs, Batch size etc to test the accuracy with all these changes.
